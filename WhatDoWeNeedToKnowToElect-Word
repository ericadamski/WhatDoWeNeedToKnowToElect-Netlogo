I want to add more to the intro, right now though i feel like i am basing it like all off the dang paper that we are using 
So im gunna work on it more tomorrow with fresh mind, skyping is option tomorrow as well :D

NOTE: Formatting comes when paper is finished being written, due to different file formats and conversion problems that may happen.  This includes double spacing(which is required), bolding, and text size.
Title: What do we need to know to elect in networks with unknown participants?
Abstract: A network with unknown participants is simply a network where the processes have very basic knowledge of the system.  Nodes in the network do not necessarily know every node participating in the network and  they will only have a subset of the total amount of nodes in which they will know about and be able to communicate directly with.  This type of network is "contact list" like, where during initial communication one can communicate with an unknown neighbour only if one has been first contacted by this neighbour (creating a communication path).  In this report we investigate the Leader Election problem in general networks with unknown participants.   Since Leader Election is a useful benchmark for computability investigations in distributed computing, this report can outline what else is solvable in networks that also contain unknown participants.

Introduction: Distributed systems are spreading throughout all of computer science and recently more interest has been in studying more dynamic systems.   There have not been many studies on static models where the local connectivity evolves in a light way during the computation.  
Consider a set of participants that communicate with phones.  Initially, each person (node) knows a subset (contact list) of the total amount of other people in the phone registry.  This subset each node has includes everyone the node knows about including the people that do not know specifically about this node.  So for example, Frank may have Ferns number, and Fern may not know Franks number.  In this situation Frank can contact Fern, but Fern cannot communicate with Frank until first receiving a message from frank.  Fern will not even know of Franks phone possession (existence in network) until first being contacted by Frank.  During the preliminary stages of this phone network connectivity is low, it is also directed, and adjacency between nodes increases over time from computations by the network (people adding each other on contact lists).  This system is asynchronous.
In an arbitrary network, the underlying communication graph is an undirected graph denoted by G.  Nodes each have identities, and communicate with messages.  Initially a node can send messages only to a subset of its actual neighbours in G.  This defines the first directed graph G‚Å∞, the contact list of neighbours will be extended whenever a message is received from an "unknown" in-member.
