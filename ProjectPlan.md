## Algorithm Model

* Witten in Netlogo
* General Principle :
  * Create a random connect directed graph with a given population size ( slider )
  * Model the REACH Algorithm mentioned in the paper
  * Model the Leader Elect algorithm mentioned in the paper

## Algorithm Analysis

* Title
* Abstract
* Intro : Our project idea in relation to the research paper
* Body :
  * Analyize multiple runs of the leader election algorithm, plot number of nodes, number of ticks, number of messages
    * Generate Statistics, avg, std.dev, mean, etc, that describe our tests
  * Change the base algorithm ( restate the algorithm in sudo code here! ) to include distance between nodes ( instead of distance = 1 ) run the same tests as above, with randomly generated graphs
    * Generate and analyize the statistcs of the modified algorithm, if this algorithm doesn't work, we should give a short proof about why.
* Conclusion : Link back to main paper abstract, compare or prove why our test did or did not work
